yndx-xxlsort
============

The classic external sort problem: sort a file larger than the amount of available RAM.

C++11, Posix.

_Xxlsort.cpp_, _util.hpp_ and _util.cpp_ are the source code of the sort utility.

_Binariser.cpp_ and _generate.py_ are fragments of the testing framework (see comments in the source).
