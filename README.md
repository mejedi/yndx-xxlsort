yndx-xxlsort
============

The classic external sort problem: sort a file larger than the amount of available RAM.

C++11, Posix.

[Xxlsort.cpp](xxlsort.cpp), [util.hpp](util.hpp) and [util.cpp](util.cpp) are the source code of the sort utility.

[Binarizer.cpp](binarizer.cpp) and [generate.py](generate.py) are fragments of the testing framework (see comments in the source).
